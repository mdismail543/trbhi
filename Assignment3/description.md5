Troubleshooting process :

I have check the process with ps -ef|grep redis command, I see the process is running. 
Then i have check the /etc/redis/redis.conf file it seems to be good. 
Then i check the status it show redis is running.
 Then i have restarted the redis with service command and it started well and status also good. 
 I have did some health check and it shows the correct output

Whats wrong:

Nothing is wrong

How fixed it:

I did nothing just restarted the service and did basic health check
