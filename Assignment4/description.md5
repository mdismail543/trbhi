Troubleshooting process :

Once I have logged into windows machine, I have try load the url but i got 503 service unavailable. 
This is an error indicating service has issue with starting. Then I checked the event logs  I see the below error. 
"Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) encountered a failure when it started a worker process to serve the application pool"

then I try to start it but unable to do so. After checking sometime the defaultpool identity is not correct I have changed it and restarted it,
It started working 


Whats wrong:

application pool is running under a specific identity, which cause the issue 


How fixed it:

In IIS, go to Application Pools, and check the Identity of your Application Pool.
I Try changing the Identify to a Built-in account like ApplicationPoolIndentity. To do this, go to Advanced Settings, Process Model, Identity. 
Restarted the App Pool after making changes. I am able load the page
